# Ion Trap Computational Modelization

This repository contains MATLAB implementations for simulating ion confinement in a **Paul ion trap** using numerical methods (Method of Moments, potential calculations, trajectory prediction).  
The project explores quadrupole potentials, charge distributions, and optimal trap parameters based on ion properties and electrode geometry.

## 📄 Additional Report — Wound Healing (Computational Mechanics)
This repository also includes a second academic report related to **morphoelastic modeling of wound healing**, exploring:

- Stress-free, stressed, wounded, and healing tissue configurations  
- Neo-Hookean constitutive laws  
- FEM simulations of wound opening  
- Influence of material parameters and traction  
- Analytical derivations of deformation and stress tensors
